# 🌎 Country Fact Generator 🌎

Welcome to my Country Fact Generator! This is a personal project where I'm practicing my newly learnt PHP skills and applying web accessibility concepts I learned in the [Web Design Accessibility Certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-a794dfd1-6f13-49de-894d-57155c2d0041/).


## ✨ About the Project ✨

This project displays facts about different countries. Each time you click the "New Country" button, you'll get a random fact card showcasing a different nation.

The country data is fetched from the wonderful [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), making this project a great way to practice working with external APIs.

## 🎯 Project Goals 🎯

* **PHP Basics:**  Get comfortable with fundamental PHP concepts like variables, arrays and loops.
* **Accessibility:** Apply essential accessibility practices to make the fact cards usable for everyone.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack 🛠️

* PHP
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript

## 🧠 Accessibility Focus 🧠

To ensure that this page meets accessibility requirements I used the following tools:
* WAVE
* Lighthouse
* IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker
* Windows Narrator
* Silktide Inspector

## 🤗 Feedback Welcome! 🤗

As I'm still learning, I value your feedback! Please feel free to open an issue or reach out if you have any suggestions or find any accessibility improvements I could make. Sorry for the many bugs!

Let's learn about the world together! 😊
